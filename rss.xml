            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There & Back Again: A Cross-Country Epic</h1><p>It's usually late February or early March when I load up my vehicle with tools of photographic wonder to embark on a journey from Asheville, NC into the unknown and across the U.S. Destination: Las Vegas. WPPI to be exact, where I have been an educator there since 2002.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8b9656e1adc0b7119ac419bcd54748f5ecfdf92.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Timbuk2 + Blue Bottle's Sabbatical Travel Kit</h1><p>If the recent buyouts of Intelligentsia and Stumptown are any indication, the growing popularity of craft coffee shows no signs of slowing down. While single origin pour-overs are now commonplace in many coffeeshops, sometimes when you're off the beaten path, your morning cup of coffee is harder to perfect.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d979f42e1fe163d4ad2ae387a8da167c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=861&cropwidth=1576&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fba000655e6b2a554855a55a3bfaa786ed97ccb09.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
